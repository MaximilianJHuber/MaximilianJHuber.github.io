## Regulation-Induced Interest Rate Risk Exposure

<em>Job Market Paper</em>

[Draft](/assets/pdf/JMP.pdf) - [Slides (60min)](/assets/pdf/slides_NYU.pdf) - Slides (25min, soon!)

This paper documents a recent buildup of interest rate risk exposure in the U.S. financial sector and studies the role of regulation in shaping the hedging motives of financial institutions. I quantify how much interest rate risk is borne by a group of large, long-term institutional investors: life insurance companies. I find life insurers have become significantly exposed to interest rate risk. By 2019, a one-percentage-point drop in the level of interest rates would have reduced their capital by $121 billion or 26%. In addition, lower interest rates decrease the profitability of life insurers' funding franchise, which is the issuance of new policies. To explain this risk-taking behavior, I provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence that show how statutory reserve regulation distorts the economic motive to hedge interest rate risk. My model offers recommendations for changes in existing regulation to align it with macro-prudential principles.

## Lending Frictions in the Corporate Bond Market: Evidence from Life Insurance Companies

<em>Winner of the 2019 NYU Economics Third-Year Paper Award</em>

[Draft](/assets/pdf/LendingFrictions.pdf)

This paper documents that adverse financial shocks to life insurance companies propagate to firms in the real economy that borrow from them via the corporate bond market. First, I show that lending relationships are sticky beyond the refinancing of corporate bonds and that holdings are concentrated among few, large institutional investors. Then, I estimate the effect of a negative financial shock, measured by Koijen and Yogo (2015), on borrowings, interest rates, capital expenditures, and employment growth. I find negative effects that are about half of what has been measured in the literature on relationship banking. This is evidence that lending frictions also prevail in the open market for credit.

## A Mortgage Genealogy of New York City

<em>joint work with Daniel Stackman</em>

work-in-progress

We create a family tree of mortgage agreements that tracks the issuance, change of lender, consolidation, repayment, and sale of every commercially operated property in New York City. We study the advent of covenants in these contracts and find more than 25% contain a downward nominal rigidity: the landlord must not decrease the rent.
