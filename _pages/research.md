## The Interest Rate Risk of Life Insurers

Life insurers have taken on increasing amounts of interest rate risk since the beginning of the low interest rate environment. I find that lower interest rates compress the spread between what life insurers can earn investing and what they pay on newly issued liabilities. I estimate the duration of the existing liabilities and find a negative duration of the legacy balance sheet. This is remarkable, because it means that life insurers amplify their risk taking by correlating lower profitability with a capital loss on their existing balance sheet. This behaviour may be due to a regulatory friction disturbing the economic hedging motive.
