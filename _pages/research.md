## Regulation-induced Interest Rate Risk Exposure

<em>Job Market Paper</em>

[Draft](/assets/pdf/JMP.pdf) [Slides (60min)](/assets/pdf/slides_NYU.pdf)

This paper documents a recent buildup of interest rate risk exposure in the U.S. financial sector and studies the role of regulation in shaping the hedging motives of financial institutions. I quantify how much interest rate risk is borne by a large, long-term institutional investor, the life insurance companies. I find life insurers have become significantly exposed to interest rate risk. By 2019, a one percentage point drop in the level of interest rates would have reduced their net assets by $162 billion or 19%. In addition, lower interest rates decrease the profitability of life insurers' funding franchise, which is the issuance of new policies. To explain this risk-taking behavior, I provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence that show how statutory reserve regulation distorts the economic motive to hedge interest rate risk. My model offers recommendations for changes in existing regulation to align it with macro-prudential principles.

## Lending Frictions in the Corporate Bond Market: Evidence from Life Insurance Companies

<em>Winner of the 2019 NYU Economics Third-Year Paper Award</em>

[Draft](/assets/pdf/LendingFrictions.pdf)

I document that adverse shocks to life insurance companies propagate to firms which borrow from them via corporate bonds. This is evidence that lending frictions prevail in the open market for credit, as they do in relationship banking. I estimate their effect on financial and real outcomes to be more than half of what they are for banking during late 2008.
