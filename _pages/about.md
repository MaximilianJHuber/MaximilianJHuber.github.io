I am a PhD candidate in economics at New York University. My research interests include financial economics, macro-finance, and asset pricing. 

I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the EEA and ASSA meetings. In my [job market paper](/assets/pdf/JMP.pdf), I document a recent buildup of interest rate risk exposure in the U.S. financial sector and study the role of regulation in shaping the hedging motives of financial institutions.
